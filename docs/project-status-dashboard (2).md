## Immediate Priorities

1. Document development environment requirements
2. Detail API integration patterns
3. Add platform-specific considerations

Would you like me to update the Technical Architecture document to include these implementation details? I can focus on:

1. Environment Requirements:
   - Python version and virtual environment setup
   - Required packages and versions
   - Platform-specific dependencies
   - Development tools recommendations

2. API Integration Details:
   - Deepgram streaming setup and best practices
   - ElevenLabs voice generation patterns
   - Claude Haiku integration specifics
   - Error handling patterns for each service

3. Platform Considerations:
   - Windows audio handling
   - macOS considerations
   - Linux setup requirements

Which of these would you like me to detail first?
